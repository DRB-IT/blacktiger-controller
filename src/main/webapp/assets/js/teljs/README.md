tel.js - An input[tel] directive for AngularJS.
=================

A filter and a directive for input type 'tel' that formats and parses international phone numbers.
Based on metadata from libphonenumber.

Demo: http://michaelkrog.github.io/tel.js/

## USAGE ##

__FILTER__
```javascript
var formattedNumber = $filter('telephone')('4512341234');
```
formattedNumber: +45 12 34 12 34


__DIRECTIVE__

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="teljs">
    <head>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.24/angular.min.js"></script>
        <script src="tel.js"></script>

    </body>
</html>
```

##FILE FORMAT##
The metadatalite.js file is taken directly from the libphonenumber repository. The format is defined by Google protobuf definitions and is there not very human readable. The following is a partly definition of the format - enough to build tel.js around the file.

__It is two Arrays__

The whole file consists of 2 objects in the variables `i18n.phonenumbers.metadata.countryCodeToRegionCodeMap` and `i18n.phonenumbers.metadata.countryToMetadata`.

`i18n.phonenumbers.metadata.countryCodeToRegionCodeMap` holds a map of which countries use a given areacode.(fx. +45 is Denmark only, but +1 is a [NANPA](http://www.nanpa.com/) number and is used for USA, Canada and at least 20 other countries. The map refers to an array of countrycodes that uses a given area code having the main country as the first element in the array.

`i18n.phonenumbers.metadata.countryToMetadata` holds metadata for each country. Each metadata entry is retrieved by its countrycode(fx. 'DK'). The metadata entry is an array whici format is partly explained in the following table:
